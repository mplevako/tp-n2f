#### TP-N2F encoder-decoder model
This is an implementation of TP-N2F, a new encoder-decoder model based on Tensor Product Representations (TPRs) for Natural- to Formal-language generation proposed in [Natural- to formal-language generation using Tensor Product Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02339).
